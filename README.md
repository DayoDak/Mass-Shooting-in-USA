## Conclusions and Recommendations

- Illinios and Texas has the highest gun violence incidence in the country.

Overall, gun violence remains a complex and multifaceted issue in the United States, and addressing it will require a comprehensive approach that addresses both the availability of firearms and the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to violence.
Stricter gun control laws and evaluation of mental health are necessary to prevent mass shootings and reduce overall levels of gun violence in the country.

Efforts should be made to address the root causes of gun violence, such as poverty, mental illness, and social isolation. These efforts must include improving access to mental health services, reducing economic inequality, and increasing funding for community programs that promote social connection and support.
